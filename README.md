# Computational Vision
"Computational Vision" repository is a comprehensive collection of materials and projects related to the Computational Vision course offered at the University of Genova for the Computer Science Master's degree program.
## Overview
### Assignments
The assignments folder contains a series of projects and exercises that were assigned throughout the course.
### Final project
The centerpiece of this repository is the final project, which showcases the application of computational vision techniques to address complex challenges. The project focuses on four key areas:

Image Alignment: Techniques and algorithms to align images accurately, which is crucial for various applications like panoramic image stitching or when analyzing sequences of images taken from different perspectives.

Form Alignment: This involves aligning and recognizing structured forms or documents, which is essential for automated data extraction and processing.

Image Stitching: Combining multiple images with overlapping fields of view to produce a high-resolution panoramic image, demonstrating the practical application of image alignment and transformation techniques.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Implementing OCR to convert different types of images containing text into machine-encoded text, which is vital for data digitization and automated text processing.
